Lett. 91, 083903 (2007); 10.1063/1.2772763 Magnetoacoustic tomography with magnetic induction for imaging electrical impedance of biological tissue Medical devices equipped with position sensors enable applications like image guided surgical interventions, reconstruction of three-dimensional 3D ultrasound ͑US͒ images, and virtual or aug-mented reality systems. The acquisition of three-dimensional position data in real time is one of the key technologies in this field. The systematic distortions induced by various metals, surgical tools, and US scan probes in different commercial electromagnetic tracking systems were assessed in the presented work. A precise nonmetallic six degree-of-freedom measurement rack was built that allowed a quantitative comparison of different electromagnetic trackers. Also, their performance in the presence of large metallic structures was quantified in a phantom study on an acrylic skull model in an operating room ͑OR͒. The trackers used were alternating current ͑ac͒ and direct current ͑dc͒ based systems. The ac trackers were, on average, distorted by 0.7 mm and 0.5° by metallic objects positioned at a distance greater than 120 mm between the geometrical center of the sample and the sensor. In the OR environment, the ac system exhibits mean errors of 3.2Ϯ2.4 mm and 2.9°Ϯ1.9°. The dc trackers are more sensitive to distortions caused by ferromagnetic materials ͑averaged value: 1.6 mm and 0.5° beyond a distance of 120 mm͒. The dc tracker shows no distortions from other conductive materials but was less accurate in the OR environment ͑typical error: 6.4Ϯ2.5 mm and 4.9°Ϯ2.0°͒. At distances smaller than approximately 100 mm between sample and sensor error increases quickly. It is also apparent from our measurements that the influence of US scan probes is governed by their shielding material. The results show that surgical instruments not containing conductive material are to be preferred when using an ac tracker. Nonferromagnetic instruments should be used with dc trackers. Static distortions caused by the OR environment have to be compensated by precise calibration methods. {\textcopyright} 1998 American Associa-tion of Physicists in Medicine. ͓S0094-2405͑98͒01611-3͔},

abstract = {IEEE This paper investigates the use of resonance-enhanced coupling to increase the received signal level in a six-degree-of-freedom electromagnetic tracking system. Resonant coupling is found to increase the efficiency of the transmitter and increase the gain of the sensing coil, resulting in improved range. However, the measurement update rate is reduced due to the settling time of the transmitter circuit and the limited bandwidth of the sensing circuit. A resistive tuning approach is proposed to balance the tradeoff between a decreased measurement bandwidth and an improved signal level.},

abstract = {The N4391A Optical Modulation Analyzer utilizes unique demodulation and equalization techniques based on the extended Kalman filter. Techniques are used to demodu- late complex signals and also to estimate signal and link (channel) parameters. As an example, demodulation of 40 Gb/s polarization-multiplexed QPSK signals is demonstrated. Estimated signal parameters include the residual carrier phase and polarization state. Link (channel) estimation is illustrated for the cases of chromatic and polarization mode dispersion. Some background informa- tion about the Kalman filter algorithm and introductory examples are also provided.},
